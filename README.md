## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a cloud engineer with a focus on managing cloud infrastructure and building scalable, serverless applications. With experience in working with Kubernetes clusters and automating infrastructure with Terraform, my goal is to create flexible, reliable, and efficient cloud-native solutions that streamline deployment and scale seamlessly as applications grow.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in cloud engineering. I work extensively with Kubernetes to manage containerized applications, ensuring they are resilient, highly available, and can scale according to demand. I have a deep understanding of container orchestration and use Kubernetes to deploy, manage, and monitor microservices architectures, ensuring they run smoothly in a cloud environment.

Additionally, I specialize in building serverless applications that minimize overhead and reduce the need for infrastructure management. Leveraging services such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, I focus on creating event-driven, cost-effective applications that only consume resources when needed. These serverless architectures allow for greater flexibility and scalability while keeping operational costs low.

A key part of my workflow involves using Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources. With Terraform, I can create reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure that can be easily deployed across different cloud environments. This approach ensures consistency and enables a more efficient, streamlined process for managing complex cloud infrastructures.

I am always exploring new technologies, tools, and best practices to improve the reliability and performance of cloud-native systems. Collaboration is central to my work, and Iâ€™m always open to feedback or contributions. Feel free to browse my projects, and if you have any questions or suggestions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub!
